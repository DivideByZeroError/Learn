<p>If you are not a first time coder you may want to skip to where it says 'HTML is...'</p> <!-- use the _p_ tag to make a section of text be displayed as a paragraph -->
<p>Coding is when we write text in a fashion that allows a computer to understand what we want it to do, when we want it to do it, aswell as how we wish it to do so. Normaly this is done by using specific phrasing and terms, but alot of these terms and methods of phrasing are different depending on what programming language you use. Despite this different coding languages tend to have things in common with alot of other languages.</p>
<p>HTML is, in my opinion, one of the easiest programing languages to learn. HTML uses terms called <div class="dropdown"><span>TAGS</span><div class="dropdown-content"><p> A full list of tags can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">here</a></p></div></div>. A tag is a term that <div class="dropdown"><span>starts with &lt; and ends with a &gt;</span><div class="dropdown-content"><p>example: &lt;body&gt;</p></div></div>. Most tags need to have a closing tag.<div class="dropdown"><span> A closing tag is used at when you are done putting information into a tag</span><div class="dropdown-content"><p>example: &lt;body&gt; this is the text for the body of my page<div class="dropdown"><span> &lt;/body&gt;</span><div class="dropdown-content"><p>this here is what a closing tag should look like. you take the tag you want to close and at the end of the information you want to put in it you put the tag in then you just add a slash.</p></div></div></div></div>. You may also want to go ahead and right click this page and select view page source.</p>
<p> so here is a quick summery</p>
<ul>
<li> html uses tags which you need to start and close
<li> you put the doctype tag and html tag at the start of you html pages
<li> a closing tag is simply the same tag with a slash after the less than
<li> a full list of tags can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">here</a>
</ul>
<p> also don't forget to change the file type in the file name from .txt to .html when you save it</p>
<p> if you have any comments, questions, or if you just want any help in general go ahead and ask. </p>
